Working with Branches:

git branch: Lists all branches.
git branch -M <new_name>: Renames the current branch.
git checkout -b <new_branch>: Creates and switches to a new branch.
git checkout <branch_name>: Switches to the specified branch.
git branch -d <branch_name>: Deletes the specified branch (cannot delete the current branch).
