Cloning and Checking Status:


1. git clone <repository_url>: Clones the repository to your local machine (replace <repository_url> with the actual link).
2. git status: Displays the status of your files (e.g., modified, untracked). 
	Untracked: A new file that Git is not tracking yet.
	Modified: A file that has been edited but not yet staged.


Workflow for Modified/Untracked Files:
1. git add <file_name>: Stages a specific file (moves it to the staging area).
2. git add . : Stages all changes (tracked and untracked files).
3. git commit -m "commit message": Records the changes with a message.
4. git push origin main: Pushes changes to the main branch of the remote repository.


Notes:
origin: Refers to the default remote repository.
main: Refers to the branch where changes are pushed.
