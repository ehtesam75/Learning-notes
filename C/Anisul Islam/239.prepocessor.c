/*
a preprocessor is a program that processes the source code before the actual compilation process. It is a tool that performs macro substitution, conditional compilation, and file inclusion in the source code.

The preprocessor directives begin with the "#" symbol and are executed before the actual compilation of the code. Some common preprocessor directives in C are:

#define - used to define macros or constants
#include - used to include files in the source code
#ifdef, #ifndef, #else, #endif - used for conditional compilation
#pragma - used to provide implementation-specific directives to the compiler.
