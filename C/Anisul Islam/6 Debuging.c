/*
Errors that occurred in program has 3 types: 1. syntax error 2. logical error 3. information error
(As of anisul sir: There are a few kinds of errors in c those aren't detected by the compiler: 4. run time error 5. compile time errors......these aren't identified by the compiler and so they are termed as "exceptions")
(As of chatgpt, verifed by gpt 4: ompile-time errors are detected by the compiler during the compilation but  Runtime errors, on the other hand, occur during program execution and are not detected by the compiler)

Compile time error: Compile-time errors, as mentioned earlier, are detected by the compiler during the compilation stage. The compiler checks the syntax and structure of the program code and reports any errors that it encounters. The compiler then generates an executable code only if there are no compile-time errors.

Run time error: Runtime errors occur during the execution of the program. These errors can be caused by a variety of factors, such as incorrect input data, divide by zero errors, or null pointer exceptions. Runtime errors are often more difficult to detect and fix than compile-time errors because they only occur during program execution.
