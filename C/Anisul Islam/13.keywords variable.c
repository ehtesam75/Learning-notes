/*token of c :
a token is the smallest unit of a program that is meaningful to the compiler. Tokens are the basic building blocks of a program and they are used to construct expressions, statements, and other constructs.

C programming language has the following types of tokens:

1. Keywords: Keywords are predefined reserved words that have special meanings in the C language. For example, "int", "float", "if", "else", "while", "return", etc.

2. Identifiers: Identifiers are user-defined names used to identify variables, functions, and other constructs in a program. Identifiers must follow certain naming rules and conventions, such as starting with a letter or underscore, and cannot be the same as a keyword.

3. Constants: Constants are fixed values that do not change during program execution. C programming language supports various types of constants, such as integer constants, floating-point constants, character constants, and string constants.

4. Operators: Operators are symbols that perform operations on operands. For example, +, -, *, /, %, =, ==, !=, <, >, etc.

5. Special Symbols: Special symbols are used for grouping, separating, or punctuating expressions and statements. For example, (, ), {, }, [, ], ;, ,, ., ->, etc.

6. string (extra added by anisul sir)


VARIABLE OF C: 
a variable is a named memory location that can hold a value. Variables are used to store and manipulate data in a program. (exam. num1 = 10; here num1 is a variable
naming: 
underscore(_), eng letter, digit, doller sign ($) can be used..
can't start with digit... 
one can name a variable that starts with a capital letter in C programming language, but it is not recommended...
variable name can't hold a space between 2 words...
31 characters can be used to name a variable, but its recomended to use 8.

float: 6 decimal places, 4bytes, %f format speciafier
double: 15 decimal places, 8bytes, %lf format specifier
