//note: Dart does not support multiple inheritance
//so a class can only extend one class


//note:
// The Rules of Precedence
// Start from the bottom, go up: Dart always starts its search for a method or 
//         variable in the actual class of the object (Car) and moves up the inheritance 
//         chain (Vehicle, then SomeClass) until it finds the first match.
// First match wins: As soon as it finds a match, it stops searching and uses that one.
// Methods use local variables: A method will always operate on variables defined within 
//          its own class scope. If it can't find the variable there, 
//          it will look up the inheritance chain until it finds the first match.
