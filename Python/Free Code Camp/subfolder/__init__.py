#The statement explains a key concept in Python package organization. 
# In Python, a directory (or subfolder) is recognized as a package if it contains a 
# special file named __init__.py. This file can be empty or contain initialization 
# code for the package. By adding __init__.py to a subfolder, 
# you enable Python to import modules from that folder using the package import syntax
# Without this file (in Python versions before 3.3), the folder would not be treated 
# as a package, and you would not be able to import its modules in the standard way. 
# Even though Python 3.3+ supports implicit namespace packages (folders without __init__.py), 
# it is still a good practice to include this file for compatibility and clarity.
