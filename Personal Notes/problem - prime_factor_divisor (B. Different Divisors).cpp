/*
divisor : prime factorization
    Prime Factorization is the process of breaking down a positive integer into a product of prime numbers
    For any integer n>1, there exists a unique prime factorization: 
    n = a^p1 * b^p2 * c^p3
    i. e n = 84
    84 can be represented as = 2^3 * 3^1 * 7^1 (84/2 => 42/2 => 21/3(next prime num after 2) =>7 (already a prime! so will stop))

    say x = 7^2 * 13^3 * 19^1
            {7^0, 7^1, 7^2}, {13^0, 13^1, 13^2, 13^3}, {19^0, 19^1}
            we can take any number of number from each of this three set 
            and then x will be always divided by their multiplicaton 

    total number of divisor of x is : (2+1) * (3+1) * (1+1);    //look at the above set, u'll understand..its just counting
    cuz we know if a a number's prime factorization is = a^x * b ^ y
    then no. of divisor is = (x +1) * (y+1)

    - we will try to find a number that has EXACTLY 4 divisor (cuz this will make the number smaller)
    - output a will be either p^3 and pq; p and q are prime (cuz if there is 2 prime factor with pow 1 then total divisor will be 4)
    - in case 1 all divisor : 1, p, p^2, p^3
        we have to find smallest prime p, that >= d+1
    - in case 2 all divisor : 1, p, q, pq
        we have to find samllest prime p , that >= d+1
        we have to find smallest prime q, that >= p + d
