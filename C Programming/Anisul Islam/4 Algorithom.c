/*
Algorithm: An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or a set of rules to solve a problem or perform a specific task

Pseudocode: Pseudocode is a high-level, informal language used to describe the steps in an algorithm or program. It is not specific to any particular programming language and can be easily understood by humans. Pseudocode uses natural language to describe the logic of a program, using keywords such as "if," "else," "while," "for," and "do-while."

Diffference between it and flowchart: Pseudocodeand flowcharts are both tools used to represent algorithms and program logic. Pseudocode is a written form of the algorithm, using natural language, whereas flowcharts use graphical symbols to represent the steps and logic of the algorithm.
basically, algorithm  = pseudocode + flowchart; meaning that an algorithm can be represented using either or both of these tools.
(but as of anisul sir, algorithm = pseudocode; means algorithm is the written part and flowchart is the graphical representation of it)

Flowchart are of 2 types: 1. System flowchart 2. program flowchart (we work with program flowchart). Check out some symbols that represent flowchart
