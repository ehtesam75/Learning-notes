/*introduction to c programing


Program: A program is a set of instructions that a computer can follow to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem

Programing language: A programming language is a language that enables programmers to write code that can be executed by a computer.

High level language = source code
Low level language = Programing in Binary = Machine code = object code

Translator Program: A translator program is a software tool that converts the source code written in the C programming language into machine-readable code, which can be executed by a computer.

Assembler: An assembler is a program that translates assembly language code into machine language code`

Regarding Mnemonic code: Assembly language code is a low-level language that consists of instructions for the processor to execute. Mnemonics are symbolic representations of these instructions, used to make the code more readable and easier to understand for humans. While mnemonics are an important part of assembly language programming, they are not the same thing as assembly language code.

Compiler: A compiler is a program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into a lower-level language (often machine code) that can be executed directly by a computer.

Interpreter: An interpreter executes source code directly without the need for a separate compilation step, translating and executing each line of code as it is encountered (translet line by line).

Difference between compiler and interpreter: 
1. Translation process: The main difference between compilers and interpreters lies in how they translate source code into executable code. A compiler translates the entire source code into machine code or bytecode all at once, while an interpreter translates and executes source code line by line.
2. Output: A compiler produces an executable file that can be run independently of the compiler, whereas an interpreter executes the code directly and does not produce an independent executable file.
3. Error handling: A compiler checks for errors in the entire program before generating the executable code, while an interpreter checks for errors line by line as it executes the code.
4. Performance: Compiled code generally runs faster than interpreted code because the translation process is done beforehand. However, interpreted code can be more flexible and easier to debug.
5. Portability: Compiled code is usually platform-specific and needs to be recompiled for different platforms, while interpreted code can run on any platform that has an interpreter installed.
(compiler often uses in big type of computer where interpreter is mainly used in micro computer)
