/*
A recursive function is a function that calls itself within its own definition. Recursive calls allow a function to repeatedly solve subproblems until it reaches a base case, which is a situation where the function can return a result without making further recursive calls.

The base case is a condition that stops the recursion and allows the function to return a result. It is a crucial part of any recursive function because without it, the function would continue to call itself indefinitely, leading to an infinite loop and eventually a stack overflow error.

For example, consider the following recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number:

def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:  (base case)
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)  (recursive call)

In this function, the base case is when the input n is equal to 0, in which case the function returns 1. If the input is not 0, the function calculates the factorial by making a recursive call to itself with the argument n-1.
